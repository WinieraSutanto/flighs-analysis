# flights-analysis
This is a project where I observed the status of flights of US Flight Carriers in the years 2018-2022 to see the rate of delayed and cancelled flights. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/flight-delay-dataset-20182022?resource=download&select=Combined_Flights_2022.csv
